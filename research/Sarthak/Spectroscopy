    - What is light?
        - An EM Wave
        - Arranged to frequency: 1. Gamma 2. X Rays 3.  UV 4. Visible (very tiny) 5. IR 6. Micro 7. Radio(very big)
        - Visible light: Wavelefngth range- 380 nm - 750nm
            - Goes from V-I-B-G-Y-O-R, where violet has the smallest wavelength yet highest frequency, and red has the largest wavelength yet lowest frequency
    - Light can:
        - Be absorbed: Material increases in temperature. Then it is reemitted most likely
        - Be transmitted: Passes straight through (very unlikely, some is transmitted, some is reflected, some is absorbed almost always)
        - Be reflected: Anything visible is seen because it reflects light
    - If we spread out light wavelengths (spectra), we can examine which ones are transmitted, which ones are emitted, which ones are absorbed
    - For this, we need a **SPECTROSCOPE**
        - Dispersion: Light being refracted through material, and then dispersed into its separate spectra
        - Diffraction: Light interacts with a surface that spreads out the light
            - Most commonly used for spectroscopy
                - We use a diffraction grating for this
    - SPECTROSCOPE:
        - A tube with diffraction grating
        - Spectrometer- look at each of the individual wavelengths
            - Moving a scope around the spreading of the colours. (this is just what a spectrometer does in a NUTSHELL, its not what it actually does).
            - Allows for the measurement of angles which can help determine the light’s wavelength

    - Example of a situation:
        - We use a light source that gives of white light
            - Light comes out
            - Examine light with spectroscope/spectrometer (we will get an unblocked, continous spectrum of all wavelengths/spectra)

        - IF the white light encounters a substance, the substance absorbs some of that light, and some is emitted
            - So the spectrum would no longer be continuous
            - Example where H2 is in front of spectrometer

    - In this example, there are clearly 4 key solid wavelengths that are being blocked by the $H_2$ gas. This type of spectrum is an absorption spectrum, it shows what the hydrogen gas absorbs
    - IF you look at the light that is emitted from the substance, in this case the hydrogen gas, you get an emission spectrum, which shows what it emits back:

    - Essentially:

    $$
    λ_E + λ_A = λ_C
    $$

    - Where λ is the visible light spectrum, E is emitted, A is absorbed, and C is continuous
    - Note: Only true conceptually, not mathematically

    - Can use both emission and absorption spectrum for analyzing data
    - Light spectra from the Sun:

    - A light’s colour depends entirely on its emission spectrum

    - A spectrometer analyzes the light that is coming through a diffraction grating
    - The amount of diffraction that takes place is related to a few variables
    - $dsinθ = mƛ$
    - where d is the distance between individual slits of the diffraction grating
        - 1000 line diffraction grating = 1000 lines per mm, therefore d = 10^-6 m
