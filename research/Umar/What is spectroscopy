Spectroscopy is the study of how light and other forms of radiation are absorbed and emitted by different materials. It is researched by splitting light into its respective wavelengths similar to how a prism separates color.
Many researchers nowadays use diffraction grating film to do this sort of research.

Where can spectroscopy be used?:
In our situation spectroscopy will be used to find the composition of the atmosphere by looking at the wavelengths of the light that is in the atmosphere. Each element that light passes through creates a unique set which we can see on a spectrum. For example Hydrogen would have three strong lines on a spectrum which would be violet,  cyan, and red.

How Spectroscopy Works:
Light-Matter Interaction: When light (or other electromagnetic radiation) interacts with matter, it can be absorbed, emitted, or scattered. Each substance interacts with light in a unique way depending on its atomic or molecular structure.

Energy Transitions:

Atoms and molecules have discrete energy levels.When they absorb energy, electrons jump to higher energy levels.When they return to lower energy levels, they release energy as light (photons). The specific energies (wavelengths) involved in these transitions form a spectrum.

Measuring Spectra:A spectrometer separates incoming light into its component wavelengths. The resulting pattern—called a spectrum—can be recorded and analyzed.

Types of Spectroscopy:Absorption Spectroscopy: Measures what wavelengths are absorbed by a sample. Emission Spectroscopy: Measures light emitted from a sample. Fluorescence, Infrared (IR), UV-Vis, Raman, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry are all specialized forms that focus on different parts of the spectrum or interaction types.
